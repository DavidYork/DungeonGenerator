# DungeonGenerator

This is a simple C# dungeon generator intended for roguelikes and RPGs.

## Usage

Make sure you set the project "Test.DungeonFloorGenerator" to your Startup Project. Then run the program. This will generate dungeons in a text console program you can look at. The actual data structures and generator algorithm for the dungeons is in the Architect project.
